On September 26, 2021, I embarked on an awe-inspiring adventure through the Enchantments, a renowned trail nestled in the captivating wilderness of Washington. Spanning 21 miles and boasting a staggering elevation gain of 5000 ft, this trail promised a challenging yet rewarding experience amidst nature's breathtaking beauty.

## Trail Details
The trail, a non-loop route, offered a thrilling journey that began at the Colchuck Lake Trailhead and concluded at the Snow Lake Trailhead. Departing at the crack of dawn at 5 AM, we set out to explore this majestic terrain and it was almost 7.15PM when we reached the Snow Lake Trailhead parking lot. One key aspect to note is that while permits are required for overnight stays, day hikes like the one I undertook do not necessitate permits, making it accessible for spontaneous adventures.

### Trailhead access
Located close to Leavenworth, Washington, the trailhead is conveniently accessible via shuttle services. [Leavenworth Shuttle Services](https://www.leavenworthshuttle.com/mountain) and [Loop Connector](https://loopconnectorshuttle.com/) Shuttle offer reliable transport options, enabling easy access for hikers seeking to explore this natural wonder.

### Alternatives to Shuttles
For those preferring an alternative to shuttles, parking two cars, one at each trailhead, is a viable option. The drive between Snow Lake Trailhead and Colchuck Lake Trailhead takes approximately 30 minutes.


## Chosing the route

Opting to commence at the Colchuck Lake Trailhead and concluding at the Snow Lake Trailhead proved to be a strategic choice. Here's why:

Elevation Gain: Starting at Colchuck Lake Trailhead allowed for an initial ascent, completing the bulk of the elevation gain within the first 6.5 miles. In contrast, the alternative route would entail a continuous climb for approximately 10 miles, making the initial leg of the journey more strenuous.

Asgard Pass Descent: Descending Asgard Pass can pose challenges due to loose gravel, making it slippery. Selecting the route ending at Snow Lake Trailhead avoided this descent, offering a safer and more manageable conclusion to the hike.

## Trail Highlights

The Enchantments trail captivates adventurers with its diverse landscapes, from pristine lakes to panoramic vistas. The enchanting alpine scenery, vibrant foliage, and occasional glimpses of wildlife make every step a testament to nature's grandeur.

### In Conclusion
My trek through the Enchantments on that crisp September morning remains a vivid and exhilarating memory. The trail's proximity to Leavenworth, coupled with accessible shuttle services and the option for a two-car solution, makes it an enticing destination for outdoor enthusiasts.

For those planning to explore this trail, be mindful of permit requirements for overnight stays, and consider the Colchuck Lake Trailhead start for a smoother ascent and a safer descent from Asgard Pass.
